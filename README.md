## 3DS Same Game

This is a homebrew game for the 3DS.

Description of the game itself:
A game where blocks with different colors are ordered randomly to form a field. 
Blocks which have at least one neighbor with the same color could be deleted. 
If blocks are deleted the remaining blocks always move up to the left bottom corner 
of the game board. The goal of the Same Game is to delete all blocks of the field.

Playing instructions:
The game is very simple to play, just use the touch-screen as input. Unfortunately
it is in a very early state, so that there is no option to play it again after it's
finished, thus just press the START button to exit.
